# 07-Firebase-Assignment-Train-Scheduler
Front-end train schedule application

# Description
My application will accept user input and give a new train name, start time and frequency each day.  There should be a display schedule that repeats with a next arrival time that is engaged with the current time and frequency of stops.  The app will store train info into Firebase and also retrieves data. The scheduler will refresh often to coincide with updated arrival information.
